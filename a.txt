Subject: Request: WiFi Penetration Testing - Mumbai | Chennai Location

Dear Network Support Team,

We are planning to conduct a comprehensive WiFi penetration test at our Mumbai and Chennai office locations.

Proposed Timeline:
We are looking to schedule this assessment and would like to coordinate with your team to find a suitable window, ideally within the next 2 weeks.
We anticipate the testing will take approximately 5 days per location.

Pre-requisite Requirements from Network Support:

To ensure the testing is conducted efficiently and safely, we require the following from your team before we begin:

Formal Authorization: Written approval (email is fine) from network owners acknowledging and authorizing this testing.

Network Information (for both locations):

A list of all SSIDs currently in scope (e.g., Corporate_WiFi, Guest_WiFi, etc.).

The authentication methods used for each SSID (e.g., WPA2-PSK, 802.1x RADIUS, Captive Portal).

Up-to-date wireless network diagrams.

IP address ranges used by the wireless clients on each SSID.

Points of Contact:

Primary and secondary technical contacts at both the Mumbai and Chennai locations who can be reached during the testing.

An emergency contact for after-hours, in the event of any unexpected service disruption.

System Whitelisting:

We will provide the source IP addresses and/or MAC addresses of our testing equipment. Please ensure these are whitelisted in any Wireless Intrusion Prevention Systems (WIPS) or other monitoring tools to avoid blocking our legitimate test traffic.

Test Accounts (if applicable):

For testing authenticated networks (like the corporate SSID), we will require temporary, non-privileged user credentials.

Could we please schedule a brief 30-minute call next week to discuss these pre-requisites, finalize the scope, and agree on a testing schedule that minimizes any potential disruption to business operations?
