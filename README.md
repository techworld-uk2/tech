Here is a comprehensive and structured internal VAPT (Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing) checklist specifically designed for network devices. It covers critical aspects such as configuration analysis, security checks, management protocols, and potential attack vectors. Use it to ensure a thorough assessment of the internal infrastructure.

‚úÖ Internal VAPT Checklist for Network Devices
1. Pre-assessment Activities
 Obtain explicit authorization (written approval).

 Define scope clearly (IPs, devices, segments, VLANs).

 Confirm emergency contacts and escalation procedures.

 Backup device configuration prior to assessment.

2. Device Enumeration & Discovery
 Conduct ping sweeps and ARP scans to identify live hosts.

 Enumerate network devices using tools like:

Nmap

Netdiscover

Nessus (with device discovery plugins)

 Create comprehensive inventory (including IP addresses, hostnames, device types, OS and versions).

3. Port and Service Identification
 Perform detailed port scan using Nmap (TCP/UDP).

 Document all open ports and services running.

 Identify unnecessary or potentially insecure open services (telnet, ftp, SNMP v1/v2, etc.).

 Enumerate banners to identify specific device models and software versions.

4. Credential and Authentication Assessment
 Verify device access (SSH, Telnet, web GUI) and authentication mechanisms.

 Test for default, weak, or commonly used credentials.

 Attempt brute-force/dictionary attacks (with proper permission and controls).

 Check if multi-factor authentication is implemented.

5. Configuration Security Review
 Validate proper implementation of VLAN segmentation.

 Verify use of encrypted management protocols (SSH over telnet, HTTPS over HTTP).

 Inspect Access Control Lists (ACLs) for proper configuration.

 Check presence of unused services or unnecessary protocols (CDP, LLDP, HTTP admin, telnet, TFTP, SNMP v1/v2, etc.).

 Ensure appropriate logging and audit trails (logging to a secure external server, log severity level configured appropriately).

 Validate timeout sessions configuration.

Understood! Here's a detailed checklist specifically tailored for Internal Penetration Testing focused primarily on exploiting vulnerabilities in network devices, rather than a pure configuration review. This checklist prioritizes active testing and attack vectors:

‚úÖ Internal Penetration Testing Checklist for Network Devices
‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: Initial Enumeration & Reconnaissance
 Identify live hosts:

ARP sweeps, ICMP scanning (nmap -sn, arp-scan).

TCP SYN scans (nmap -sS -Pn).

UDP scans (nmap -sU).

Service/version detection (nmap -sV).

 Banner grabbing & fingerprinting:

Verify device model, software, and firmware versions from banners (nmap --script=banner).

 Identify management interfaces (web, telnet, SSH, SNMP).

üîë Step 2: Authentication & Credential Attacks
 Default credentials testing:

Attempt to access management interfaces (web GUI, SSH, telnet, SNMP, console) using vendor defaults.

 Weak credential identification:

Dictionary or brute-force attacks with tools like Hydra, Medusa, Ncrack.

bash
Copy
Edit
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt ssh://<TARGET_IP>
 SNMP brute-force & enumeration:

Community string brute-force (onesixtyone, snmpwalk).

bash
Copy
Edit
onesixtyone -c community.txt <TARGET_IP>
snmpwalk -c public -v1 <TARGET_IP>
üíâ Step 3: Exploiting Identified Vulnerabilities
 Exploit known CVEs and vulnerabilities:

bash
Copy
Edit

Try URL manipulation, parameter injection, or header modification on web interfaces.

 Privilege escalation & command injection:

Attempt command injection, privilege escalation on device‚Äôs administrative interface.

 Path traversal attacks:

Attempt directory traversal on web-based management interfaces.

üï∏Ô∏è Step 4: Network Device-Specific Attacks
 VLAN hopping attacks:

Attempt VLAN hopping (Double-tagging, Switch Spoofing).

Tools: yersinia, manual packet crafting.

 ARP spoofing & MITM attacks:

Test ARP cache poisoning to intercept traffic.

Tools: ettercap, arpspoof, Bettercap.

Tools: hping3, slowloris, custom scripts.

 Protocol-specific DoS:

Test specific protocol vulnerability for denial of service conditions.

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Always ensure DoS testing is explicitly authorized and carefully coordinated with your client to avoid unexpected outages.

üóÇÔ∏è Step 7: Evidence Collection & Reporting
 Document clearly every identified vulnerability and successful attack.

 Capture screenshots, logs, packet captures, detailed commands, and responses.

 Provide clear proof-of-concept examples for each issue.

üìí Recommended Tools Summary
Stage	Tools Recommended
Enumeration & Discovery	Nmap, Netdiscover, arp-scan

Regularly communicate progress and immediate critical findings to the client.

Confirm explicit permissions for each potentially harmful test.

This structured approach helps you effectively perform penetration tests, discover realistic attack paths, and document findings clearly for remediation efforts.
